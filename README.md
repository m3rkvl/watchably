## Reflection

   Me and my girlfriend always liked keeping track of films and series we watched or wanted to watch. Streaming platforms keeps rotating their libraries and they all have exclusive content. Existing alternatives' main purpose was not keeping a watchlist but we wanted an easy to use platform to keep our watchlist. So that's why I built this app in a week. A practical app with the sole purpose of keeping a watchlist.
   
   This was my first React project of my own. I have built projects with React before but this was the first "real" one. I didn't work with React Router v6.4 before this project and I didn't expect it to be so different from the previous versions, overcoming the challenges like this was an incredibly helpful learning experience.
   
   I used React, React Router, Redux, SCSS Modules, and Firebase. 
   
   I chose to use Redux because I thought that a user could add/edit different films/series at a fast pace and I wanted the state management to be able to handle that.
